#This document is intended to highliht the slack interactive message "dance" 




1. Slack bot sends message into User channel in response to a keyword

2. The user interacts with the message by clicking the buttons. This triggers an invocation of your appliction's associated "Action" URL. (still unclear what URL is best practice is it domain.com/slack/receive/?


3. Slack sends a request to Action URL, sending all information needed to identify the originating message, the user that executed the action, and the specific values you've associated with the button.
